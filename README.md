# Gender_Violence_Peru
This is an attempt to shed some light on the determinants of whether a woman will report her gender violence case. In order to do this, we codified the responses to ENARES (National Survey on Social Relations) to construct variables: a holistic indicator of gender violence (including aspects such as economic, physical and sexual violence and control or power) the partner, an indicator that measures the distribution of household tasks, age, years of study, whether the individual works, whether the individual suffered of violence during her childhood and other variates. The comments and the code here presented are written in Spanish. Every possible mistake is only responsibility of the author.
